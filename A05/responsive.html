      <h2>Living well with floods</h2>
      <p>Dr. Druschke, an associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, builds from her cross-disciplinary training in rhetorical studies, ecological science, and community-based learning to investigate the logics, practices, and consequences of freshwater restoration and management. With a particular focus on southwestern Wisconsin's flood-prone Driftless Area, she works closely with a variety of community-based organizations to conduct field-based, mixed methods research to support community-level flood resilience.</p>
